# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe AI – GUI with Alpha-Beta Pruning

This project is a graphical Tic Tac Toe game where the player competes against an AI that uses the Minimax algorithm optimized with Alpha-Beta Pruning. Developed as a lab task for the Artificial Intelligence course.

## 🧠 Features

- Interactive GUI built using `tkinter`
- AI opponent plays optimally using Alpha-Beta Pruning
- The game ends with pop-up alerts for win, loss, or draw
- Clean, simple 3x3 board interface

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x installed on your system

### Run the game:
```bash
python Tic Tac Toe Game.py
```

No external libraries are required – the tkinter comes built-in with Python.

 ### 📚 Algorithms Used
Minimax Algorithm: Simulates all possible moves to choose the best outcome for the AI. <br>
Alpha-Beta Pruning: Improves Minimax by eliminating branches that won’t affect the final decision.
